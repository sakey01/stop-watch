## Stop Watch

Have the power of time in your hands with this stop watch. Outcompetes regular clocks by 1 ms.

## 🧠 What I learned

- Utilising `useref` to avoid unecessary re-renders
- Making use of `duration-pretty` to format time correctly
- `setInterval` to continuously update the timer
-  Using `clearInterval` to clean up the function

## 🛠️ Dependencies
`react` `tailwindcss` `vite` `lucide-react` `duration-pretty`
